One of the things that drew us to the house is the Dearborn Park neighborhood.  It's a tree-lined communutiy that has only one and entrance so that it is gated off from the surrounding busy streets.  The streets are quiet and green with trees.  It feels like a suburban street right in the heart of the city.

There's always plenty of room to park with free zoned parking on the streets of Dearborn Park.   The townhouse has two places to park with a 1 car garage and and large parking pad.  

The neighborhood is very dog friendly.  Dogs in the community are common, but always friendly and on leashes.  The area is one of the most dog-friendly in the city and ample room for dog-walking. 

Dearborn Park is home to highly rated South Loop Elementary School as well as the fantastic Cottontail Park.  It is a quiet suburban-like community with all the perks of city right at your finger tips.
